## [5.0.0] - 2023-04-05

### Changes

- Updated the `java-jwt` dependency version
- Increases free Dashboard user count to 3

### Fixes

- Fixed creating JWTs using MongoDB if a key already exists

### Breaking changes

- Using an internal `SemVer` class to handle version numbers. This will make handling CDI version ranges easier.
- Support for CDI version `2.21`
    - Removed POST `/recipe/handshake`
    - Added `useDynamicSigningKey` into `createNewSession` (POST `/recipe/session`), replacing
      `access_token_signing_key_dynamic` used in CDI<=2.18
    - Added `useStaticSigningKey` into `createSignedJWT` (POST `/recipe/jwt`)
    - Added `checkDatabase` into `verifySession` (POST `/recipe/session/verify`), replacing
      `access_token_blacklisting` used in CDI<=2.18
    - Removed `idRefreshToken`, `jwtSigningPublicKey`, `jwtSigningPublicKeyExpiryTime` and `jwtSigningPublicKeyList`
      from responses
    - Deprecated GET `/recipe/jwt/jwks`
    - Added GET `/.well-known/jwks.json`: a standard jwks
- Added new access token version
    - Uses standard prop names (i.e.: `sub` instead of `userId`)
    - Contains the id of the signing key in the header (as `kid`)
    - Stores the user payload merged into the root level, instead of the `userData` prop
- Session handling function now throw if the user payload contains protected props (`sub`, `iat`, `exp`,
  `sessionHandle`, `refreshTokenHash1`, `parentRefreshTokenHash1`, `antiCsrfToken`)
    - A related exception type was added as `AccessTokenPayloadError`
- Refactored the handling of signing keys
- `createNewSession` now takes a `useStaticKey` parameter instead of depending on the
  `access_token_signing_key_dynamic` config value
- `createJWTToken` now supports signing by a dynamic key
- `getSession` now takes a `checkDatabase` parameter instead of using the `access_token_blacklisting` config value
- Updated plugin interface version to 2.21

### Configuration Changes

- `access_token_signing_key_dynamic` is now deprecated, only used for requests with CDI<=2.18
- `access_token_blacklisting` is now deprecated, only used for requests with CDI<=2.18
- Renamed `access_token_signing_key_update_interval` to `access_token_dynamic_signing_key_update_interval`

### Database Changes

- Added new `useStaticKey` field into session info
- Manual migration is also required if `access_token_signing_key_dynamic` was set to false

#### Migration steps for SQL

- If using `access_token_signing_key_dynamic` false:
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE session_info ADD COLUMN use_static_key BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT(true);
    ALTER TABLE session_info ALTER COLUMN use_static_key DROP DEFAULT;
    ```
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO jwt_signing_keys(key_id, key_string, algorithm, created_at)
      select CONCAT('s-', created_at_time) as key_id, value as key_string, 'RS256' as algorithm, created_at_time as created_at
      from session_access_token_signing_keys;
    ```
- If using `access_token_signing_key_dynamic` true or not set:
  - ```sql
    ALTER TABLE session_info ADD COLUMN use_static_key BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT(false);
    ALTER TABLE session_info ALTER COLUMN use_static_key DROP DEFAULT;
    ```

#### Migration steps for MongoDB

- If using `access_token_signing_key_dynamic` false:
    ```
    db.session_info.update({},
      {
        "$set": {
          "use_static_key": true
        }
      });
    ```
    ```
    db.key_value.aggregate([
      {
        "$match": {
          _id: "access_token_signing_key_list"
        }
      },
      {
        $unwind: "$keys"
      },
      {
        $addFields: {
          _id: {
            "$concat": [
              "s-",
              {
                $convert: {
                  input: "$keys.created_at_time",
                  to: "string"
                }
              }
            ]
          },
          "key_string": "$keys.value",
          "algorithm": "RS256",
          "created_at": "$keys.created_at_time",
          
        }
      },
      {
        "$project": {
          "keys": 0,
          
        }
      },
      {
        "$merge": {
          "into": "jwt_signing_keys",
          
        }
      }
    ]);
    ```

- If using `access_token_signing_key_dynamic` true or not set:
    ```
    db.session_info.update({},
      {
        "$set": {
          "use_static_key": false
        }
      });
    ```

## [4.6.0] - 2023-03-30

- Add Optional Search Tags to Pagination API to enable dashboard search

### New APIs:

- `GET /user/search/tags` retrieves the available search tags

## [4.5.0] - 2023-03-27

- Add TOTP recipe

### Database changes:

- Add new tables for TOTP recipe:
    - `totp_users` that stores the users that have enabled TOTP
    - `totp_user_devices` that stores devices (each device has its own secret) for each user
    - `totp_used_codes` that stores used codes for each user. This is to implement rate limiting and prevent replay
      attacks.
    - `user_last_active` that stores the last active time for each user.

### New APIs:

- `GET /users/count/active` to fetch the number of active users after the given timestamp.
- `POST /recipe/totp/device` to create a new device as well as the user if it doesn't exist.
- `POST /recipe/totp/device/verify` to verify a device. This is to ensure that the user has access to the device.
- `POST /recipe/totp/verify` to verify a code and continue the login flow.
- `PUT /recipe/totp/device` to update the name of a device. Name is just a string that the user can set to identify the
  device.
- `GET /recipe/totp/device/list` to get all devices for a user.
- `POST /recipe/totp/device/remove` to remove a device. If the user has no more devices, the user is also removed.
